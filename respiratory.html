            <h1 class="heading">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF BIRDS:-</h1><br>
            <p class="info">The bird's respiratory system consists of paired lungs, which contain
                static structures with surfaces for gas exchange, and connected air sacs,
                which expand and contract causing air to move through the static lungs.Birds can
                breathe through the mouth or the nostrils (nares). Air entering these openings (during
                inspiration) passes through the pharynx & then into the trachea (or windpipe).
                The trachea is generally as long as the neck.</p><br><br>
            <h3 class="info">How is the respiratory system of birds modified?</h3>
            <p class="info">Birds do not have a diaphragm; instead, air is moved in and out of the
                respiratory system through pressure changes in the air sacs. Muscles in
                the chest cause the sternum to be pushed outward. This creates a negative
                pressure in the air sacs, causing air to enter the respiratory system.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Do birds breathe through their mouth?</h1>
            <p class="info">The avian respiratory system is different from that of other vertebrates,
                with birds having relatively small lungs plus air sacs that play an important
                role in respiration (but are not directly involved in the exchange of gases).
                The air sacs permit a unidirectional flow of air through the lungs.Three distinct sets of organs
                perform respiration â€” the anterior air sacs, the lungs, and the posterior air sacs.
                In addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction
                from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and out of the anterior air sacs.
                Their respiratory systems must also be highly efficient to meet those huge
                demands for oxygen. So, like us, birds take in air through the mouth and
                nostrils via a tube called a trachea, but after that, all likenesses end.</p><br><br>
            <p>The external respiration system uses the lungs and a much larger series of
                air sacs distributed throughout the body so that the oxygen supply
                communicates directly with body parts. Oxygen is taken in and exchanged
                for carbon dioxide waste in the blood, then the carbon dioxide is moved
                out; so far, much like mammals. But in birds, the air flow is one way,
                through tubes and chambers, rather than two ways, in and out of the
                lungs, as it is in mammals. And when a bird inhales, air actually
                leaves its lungs; fresh air enters the lungs as it exhales.
