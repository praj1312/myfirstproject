    <h1 class="heading1">MORE INFORMATION ABOUT BIRDS</h1>
    <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves 
         characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
          a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
           Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to
            the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. </p>
            <p>There are about ten thousand living species, more 
            than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose 
            development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are
             the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds
              the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in
               some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The 
               digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
                Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some 
                waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.Birds are feathered theropod
                 dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds 
                 are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their
                  closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the
                   primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared
                    about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence,
                     modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and
                      diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene
                       extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all
                        non-avian dinosaurs.Many social species pass on knowledge across
                         generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social, 
                         communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating
                          in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and
                           mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially 
                           (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding
                            season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other 
                species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females)  
         or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying 
         eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest
          and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after
           hatching.</p>
        <p> Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption 
            and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds 
            being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other
             species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a
              fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have
               become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more 
               before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction,
                though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an
                 important part of the ecotourism industry.</p>
                 <h2 class="abc">WHAT MAKES A BIRD A BIRD?????</h2>
                 <P>Birds were able to become flying machines largely through the evolutionary 
                     gifts of feathers, powerful wings, hollow bones, warm blood, a remarkable
                      respiratory system, and a large, strong heart.</P>
                      <P>These adaptations all boil down to the two prime requirements for any
                           flying machine: high power and low weight.</P>
