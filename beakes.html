            <h2>What are the types of bird beaks?</h2>
            <p>I]Meat-eater: Owls and birds of prey, such as this golden eagle, have powerful, deeply hooked beaks. ...
                II] Fruit-and nut-eater. Parrots, such as this blue and yellow macaw, have powerful beaks with a sharp
                hook at the tip. ...
                III]Seed-eater.
                IV]Fish-eater.
                V]Nectar-feeder.</p>
            <h2>What is the function of beak in birds?</h2>
            <P>A bird's beak or bill has the primary function of gathering and eating food.
                A bird's beak is designed to help it eat the foods it needs including tearing,
                crushing, picking, probing and breaking the shells of food items. Birds also use
                their beaks to preen or clean and oil their feathers.</P>
            <h2>What is a bird beak made of?</h2>
            <p>Instead of a face with a snout constructed from many bones, birds have an
                elongated bill, composed largely of just two bones â€“ one bone of the upper
                beak (premaxillary bone) and one for the lower jaw (mandibular bone). The
                beaked face of the modern bird looks distinctly different from the faces of
                their ancestors</p>
