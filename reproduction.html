            <p class="info">Birds reproduce by internal fertilization, during which the egg is
                fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds have cloaca, or a single
                exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings his sperm to the
                female cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg.!</p>
            <P class="info">How do birds reproduce? We know that chickens lay eggs.
                But how do they do that?

                It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this will
                involve a type of display, usually performed by the male. Some displays are very
                elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or wing or tail drumming. Most
                male birds also sing a type of song to attract females. If they are successful at
                attracting a female, it will lead to breeding.
            <p class="info">Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors?
                Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs (Figure below).
                This gives the eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting
                nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their feathers.

                To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests. ]
                Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests. Many can be
                elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows. However, some
                birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests. Instead, they lay their eggs
                on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to
                keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation.</p>
